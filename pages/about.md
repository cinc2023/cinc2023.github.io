## <a name="top"></a>Computing in Cardiology
Computing in Cardiology is an international scientific conference that has been held annually since 1974. CinC provides a forum for scientists and professionals from the fields of medicine, physics, engineering and computer science to discuss their current research in topics pertaining to computing in clinical cardiology and cardiovascular physiology.

## The Sunday Symposium
Since 1990, each scientific meeting of CinC has been preceded by a Sunday afternoon symposium highlighting current research in an area of special interest to the local hosts. The Sunday symposium provides an opportunity for attendees to learn about topics that may be new to them, to connect them with their own research interests, and to hear about the significant contributions and ongoing research coming from the laboratories and clinical research centers of the local organizers and invited speakers.

## Community
Computing in Cardiology is about more than organizing a conference, it is a society of engineers, physicians, and scientists who share a common passion for exploiting the power of computing to understand, diagnose, and treat all aspects of the heart.
