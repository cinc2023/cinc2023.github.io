## 2023 George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge

[The George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2023](https://moody-challenge.physionet.org/2023/){: target="_blank"} invites participants to predict outcome for comatose patients in the hours following resuscitation from cardiac arrest. 

The Georgi B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge asks participants to design and implement working, open-source algorithms that, based only on the provided electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and routine patient data, can predict good and poor outcomes for patients.
