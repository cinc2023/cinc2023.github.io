## Challenges Overview
PhysioNet supports open challenges, which invite participants to tackle clinically interesting questions that are either highly topical or neglected. Since the launch of PhysioNet in 1999, PhysioNet has co-hosted annual [Georg B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge](https://moody-challenge.physionet.org/){: target="_blank"} in collaboration with [Computing in Cardiology](https://cinc.org/){: target="_blank"}. We also support external challenges hosted by our wider [community](https://physionet.org/about/challenge/community-challenge){: target="_blank"}.
