We warmly invite you to the **50th Computing in Cardiology Conference 2023** in ***Atlanta, Georgia, USA, September 24th-27th, 2023***.

## Welcome to Atlanta
Atlanta is the capital of the U.S. state of Georgia. It played an important part in both the Civil War and the 1960s Civil Rights Movement. Atlanta History Center chronicles the city's past, and the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site is dedicated to the African-American leader's life and times.

## COVID-19 pandemic notice
Same as last year the CinC 2023 conference is going to be **hybrid**. There will be both an **in-person** and **remote** version of the conference taking place at the same time. If you are participating in the conference in-person, please follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline.
### CDC Guideline
As of **June 12, 2022**, CDC will no longer require air passengers traveling from a foreign country to the United States to show a negative COVID-19 viral test or documentation of recovery from COVID-19 before they board their flight.
### What You Need to Know
1. **Make sure you are up to date with your COVID-19 vaccines before you travel internationally.**
2. You **must** be fully vaccinated with the primary series of an accepted COVID-19 vaccine to travel to the United States by plane if you are a non-U.S. citizen, non-U.S immigrant (not a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, lawful permanent resident, or traveling to the United States on an immigrant visa). Only limited exceptions apply.
3. Before boarding a flight to the United States, consider getting tested for current infection with a viral test as close to the time of departure as possible (no more than 3days) before travel.
4. Wearing a mask over your nose and mouth is recommended in indoor areas of public transportation (including airplanes) and indoors in U.S. transportation hubs (including airports).\
