## <a name="top"></a><a name="visa"></a>Visa information
A citizen of a foreign country who seeks to enter the United States generally must first obtain a U.S. visa, which is placed in the traveler's passport, a travel document issued by the traveler's country of citizenship.\
A foreign national traveling to the United States for tourism needs a visitor visa (B-2) unless qualifying for entry under the Visa Waiver Program. Travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program requires ESTA Approval.

To apply for B-2 visa or ESTA, please visit **[Travel State Gov.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit.html){: target="_blank"}**.

### Center for Disease Control and Prevention Guideline
As of **June 12, 2022**, Center for Disease Control and Prevention will no longer require air passengers traveling from a foreign country to the United States to show a negative COVID-19 viral test or documentation of recovery from COVID-19 before they board their flight. **The vaccination requirement for foreign national travelers is still in effect.**\

You **must** be fully vaccinated with the primary series of an accepted COVID-19 vaccine to travel to the United States by plane if you are a non-U.S. citizen, non-U.S immigrant (not a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, lawful permanent resident, or traveling to the United States on an immigrant visa). Only limited exceptions apply.
3. Before boarding a flight to the United States, consider getting tested for current infection with a viral test as close to the time of departure as possible (no more than 3days) before travel.
