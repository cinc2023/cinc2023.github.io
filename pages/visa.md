## Entering the Untied States
A visa only allows you to travel to the United States port-of-entry (generally an airport). You will still have to be admitted at your port-of-entry. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Boarder Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit admission to the United States.
